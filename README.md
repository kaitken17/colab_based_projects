# Colab-Based Projects

Several of my projects have been work based primarily in Google Colab, and they are collected here.

### Large Learning Rates

### RNN Multiclass Integration

Code for the project resulting in our [Geometry of Integration in Text Classification RNNs paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15114.pdf) (accepted to ICLR 2021). Note this work relies on the [reverse-engineering neural networks (renn) library](https://github.com/google-research/reverse-engineering-neural-networks)

### RNN Seq2Seq

Follow-up work to the above that aims to analyze the dynamics of attention in Transformer-like and recurrent architectures.
