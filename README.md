# Colab-Based Projects

Several of my projects have been work based primarily in Google Colab, and they are collected here. Many of these are still works in progress (please don't scoop me :))

### Large Learning Rates

### RNN Multiclass Integration

Code for the project resulting in our [Geometry of Integration in Text Classification RNNs paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.15114.pdf) (accepted to ICLR 2021). Note this work relies on the [reverse-engineering neural networks (renn) library](https://github.com/google-research/reverse-engineering-neural-networks)

### RNN Seq2Seq

Follow-up work to the above that aims to analyze the dynamics of attention in Transformer-like and recurrent architectures. A paper based on this work has been submitted to ICML 2021.

### Echo-State RNN

Also a follow-up to the multi-class RNN work above. I am to leverage our understanding of how RNNs trained on such tasks behave in order to better understand the efficacy of echo-state networks.
